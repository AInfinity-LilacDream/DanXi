# DanXi
日月光华，旦复旦兮.(The sun and the moon are shining, full of glory. And the morning sun rises, again and again.)  
Maybe the best all-rounded service app for Fudan University students!  

- Campus card balance ~~and consumption records~~
- ~~Dining hall traffic~~
- Shortcut for Fudan Daily
  
(Fudan changed the API behaviours a lot around Jan 2021. Some features are unavailable.)  
This application is still in the very initial development stage, welcome to join the development ~
